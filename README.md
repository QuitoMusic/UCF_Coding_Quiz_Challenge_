# Coding Quiz UCF Bootcamp Challenge 

## Description

Testing knowledge in tecnology has become an advanced task when it comes to pre-requisites in academic topics. In order to get answers during evaluations, coding proper tests provide a framework of opportunities to make, not only the evauator but, the evaluated also, opportunities to learn new ways to create interesting and advanced ways to come back and forth as a user and a server.


This project was developed for students to understand how to link elements using all 3 platforms (HTML, CSS and, Javascript) so that diferent parameters display in our browser using a plethora of functionalities.

It's been a really interesting couple of days trying to understand the capacities of Javascipt and Web API's yet, research has been broad above what we have learned in the classroom. The extensive operations and functionalities used in all 3 platforms studied until now, has broaden the perspective of what coding really was in my mind and, this brings a lot of excitement as to what can be achieved by using these links of logical complex structures.
